Test repo for Kudu issue https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/issues/1503

As you can see it's an extremely easy console project, I've attached some screenshots that show 3 scenarios
- Local
- Azure git deployment (WebJobLocalizationTest)
- Azure upload as a zip (WebJobLocalizationTestZip)

As far as I can see, the culture directories aren't copied when using git.

Thanks!
